TCPSLICE 1.1
Now maintained by tcpdump.org
https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpslice

This directory contains source code for tcpslice, a tool for extracting
portions of packet trace files generated using tcpdump's -w flag. The
original LBL distribution is available at:

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/old/tcpslice-1.2a1.tar.gz

Tcpslice uses libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level
packet capture.  Before building tcpslice, you must first retrieve and
build libpcap, also from tcpdump.org.

Once libpcap is built (either install it or make sure it's in ../libpcap),
you can build tcpslice using the procedure in the INSTALL file.

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code contributions,
etc., should be sent to the mailing list "tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org".
